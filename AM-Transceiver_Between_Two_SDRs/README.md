# AM Transceiver (Between Two SDRs)

This project explores the transmission of an audio file from the transmitter of one SDR to the receiver of another SDR (without clock synchronization).

<strong><span style="color:red">Note: Since the demodulation technique used is not an envelope detector, the transmitter and receiver need to be highly synchronized.</span></strong>

To address this, we transmit a portion of the carrier signal along with the audio. On the receiver side, we detect the carrier peak and use it to re-center the clock, achieving relatively good synchronization between the two SDRs.
